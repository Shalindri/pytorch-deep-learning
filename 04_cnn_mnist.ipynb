The dataset contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9) with 60,000 images in the training set and 10,000 images in the test set. Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image, meaning each pixel value ranges from 0 (black) to 255 (white). The dataset is well-suited for training and testing machine learning models in image recognition tasks, and it has become a standard benchmark for evaluating algorithms.\n",
