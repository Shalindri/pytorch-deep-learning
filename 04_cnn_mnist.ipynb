    "The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The dataset contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9) with 60,000 images in the training set and 10,000 images in the test set. Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image, meaning each pixel value ranges from 0 (black) to 255 (white). The dataset is well-suited for training and testing machine learning models in image recognition tasks, and it has become a standard benchmark for evaluating algorithms.\n",

    "torch.utils.data.DataLoader is a utility in PyTorch that provides an efficient way to load and preprocess data. It allows for easy batching, shuffling, and parallel data loading using multiple workers. Key features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Batching`: Automatically groups data into batches.\n",
    "2. `Shuffling`: Randomizes the order of data samples, which is important for training neural networks.\n",
    "3. `Parallel Loading`: Utilizes multiple CPU cores to load data in parallel, reducing the time spent on data loading.\n",
    "\n",
    "DataLoader is essential for handling large datasets and ensuring efficient data feeding during the training and evaluation of models."
